      <p class="font-stylings">I have worked on two side projects, Campfire and Ensemble. Both are in HTML and CSS but Campfire was for a hackathon in which my team placed second and Ensemble was more a side project for practice.</p>
      <p class="font-stylings">A hidden talent of mine is baking! I love baking for my friends and family and have made things like cookies, cinnamon sugar soft pretzels, cinnamon rolls, snickerdoodle bars, and imitation King Hawaiian Rolls.</p>
