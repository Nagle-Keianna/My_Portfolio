      <h1>My Edited Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi my name's Keianna. I'm a sophomore CS major at Howard University. I was born in Connecticut but when I was 12 my dad lost his job and got a new one in the UAE so my whole family moved. </p>
      <p>I spent 6 years in the UAE playing touch and tackle rugby and even grew to be recognized as one of the best players in the country. I've also played for the national tackle team and did three tours with an international team.</p>
      <p>I have worked on two side projects, Campfire and Ensemble. Both are in HTML and CSS but Campfire was for a hackathon in which my team placed second and Ensemble was more a side project for practice.</p>
      <p>Here are some links to my LinkedIn and my GitHub!</p>
