      <p>Hi my name's Keianna,
            I'm a sophomore CS major at Howard University.
            I was born in Connecticut but moved to the UAE
            with my family when I was 12. I spent 6 years in the UAE
            playing touch and tackle rugby and even grew to be recognized
            as one of the best players in the country.
            I've also played for the national tackle team and done
            three tours with an international team in
            Amsterdam, Ireland, and Scotland.</p>

      <p>I have worked on two side projects,
            Campfire and Ensemble. Both are in HTML and CSS
            but Campfire was for a hackathon in which my
            team placed second and Ensemble was more a
            side project for practice.</p>

      <p>A hidden talent of mine is baking! I love baking
            for my friends and family and have made things
            like cookies, cinnamon sugar soft pretzels, cinnamon rolls,
            snickerdoodle bars, and imitation King Hawaiian Rolls.</p>
